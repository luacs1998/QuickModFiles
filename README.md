QuickModFiles - READ ME BEFORE USING
====================================

QuickMod files for luacs1998's mods, and Forge Essentials (Client). Forge Essentials Server is not available from here.

For usage instructions, please refer to https://luacs1998.wordpress.com/2014/05/11/downloading-mods-using-multimcs-quickmod-system/

If the repo breaks, file a ticket, I'll look into it. Please bear in mind that the QuickMod standard is still subject to change, as such this repo might break from time to time as I need to catch up with the standard.
